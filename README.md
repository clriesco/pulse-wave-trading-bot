## Overview

The Pulse Wave Trading Bot is a trading bot that executes trades based on various economic indicators, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data, Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) value and others. The algorithm utilizes proxies to scrape economic data and executes trading strategies on the Quantfury platform depending on the values obtained.

## Features

- Proxy Rotation: Utilizes a pool of proxies to scrape economic data, rotating between them to avoid rate limits and blocking.
- Economic Data Scraping: Fetches CPI data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and GDP data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
- Trading Strategy Execution: Executes long or short trades based on the CPI or GDP value compared to predefined thresholds.
- Configurable Algorithms: Supports multiple algorithms based on different economic indicators.
- Error Handling: Includes robust error handling to manage failed requests and retries.
- Proxyless Mode: Can operate without proxies if configured.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=14.x)
- npm (>=6.x)

  - logger.ts: Colorized logging configuration

## How It Works

### Proxy Rotation

The algorithm fetches a list of proxies from the WebShare API and rotates through them to access the target eco news data URL. This helps to avoid getting blocked by the target server due to too many requests from a single IP address.

### Economic Data Scraping

The scraper module accesses the Bureau of Labor Statistics website using the proxies to fetch the CPI data and the Bureau of Economic Analysis website to fetch the GDP and the PCE Price Index data. The respective values are extracted from specific cells in the HTML tables.

### Trading Strategy

The trading strategy is based on comparing the scraped CPI, GDP or PCE value to a predefined threshold ([PCE|CPI|GDP]VALUE_THRESHOLD).

#### For CPI:

- If the CPI value is above the threshold by more than 0.1, a short position is opened.
- If it is below the threshold by more than 0.1, a long position is opened.
- If the value is within the threshold range, no action is taken.

#### For GDP:

- If the GDP value is below the threshold by more than 0.2, a short position is opened.
- If it is above the threshold by more than 0.2, a long position is opened.
- If the value is within the threshold range, no action is taken.

#### For PCE:

- If the PCE value is above the threshold by more than 0.2, a short position is opened.
- If it is below the threshold by more than 0.2, a long position is opened.
- If the value is within the threshold range, no action is taken.

### Error Handling

Robust error handling is implemented to manage different types of errors, including failed HTTP requests and JSON parsing errors. The strategy includes retries and logging to ensure the bot continues to operate smoothly.
